# Hello! My name is Alejandro Sarmiento, and this is my GitHub Pages Site.

## My Professional Self-Assessment

As I have gone through CS-499, I have learned some value skills as well in both software design as well the broader computer science field. When the Course began, I was already challenged with creating and improving my previous work without any real direction other than a rough idea of what was necessary. That I feel was a turning point as up to this class I had been just following directions maybe I would occasionaly add in something of my own, but this course truly challenged me to look at what I had worked on up until now, look at how it could be improved, and then implement it.
